        <p>
          A neurologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating diseases
          of the nervous system. The nervous system is made of two parts: the

          spinal cord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Illnesses, disorders, and injuries that involve the nervous system

        <h1>Doctors Who Treat Insomnia</h1>
        <p>
          If you have trouble falling or staying asleep, you may have insomnia.
          If left untreated, it can stop you from getting the sleep you need.
          That can raise your risk of accidental injury and many chronic health
          conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your doctor can help diagnose and treat insomnia. Depending on your
          health history and symptoms, they may refer you to a specialist. For
          example, they may refer you to a neurologist, psychologist,
          psychiatrist, or alternative medicine practitioner.
        </p>

        <h2>Primary Care Physician</h2>
        <p>
          The first doctor you should see about your sleep problems is your
          primary care physician, or family doctor. They may offer simple
          treatment strategies to help you sleep better. For example, they may
          recommend changes to your sleep habits and overall lifestyle. They may
          also recommend changing your medication regime, especially if you’re
          currently taking drugs that can disrupt sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your primary doctor’s treatment recommendations are unsuccessful,
          they may refer you to a specialist. They may also refer you to a
          specialist if they suspect your sleep problems are caused by an
          underlying health condition.
        </p>

        <h2>Pediatrician</h2>
        <p>
          If you suspect your child has insomnia, make an appointment with a
          pediatrician. A pediatrician is a doctor who has additional training
          in treating children. They can help diagnose and prescribe appropriate
          treatment for your child. They may also refer your child to a
          specialist for further care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your child may need to see a developmental behavioral pediatrician.
          This type of pediatrician has additional training in behavioral,
          developmental, and learning issues. Some children with sleep disorders
          have underlying issues that should be addressed.
        </p>

        <h2>Sleep Medicine Specialist</h2>
        <p>
          The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) offers subspecialty
          certification in a variety of areas, including sleep medicine. Many
          different types of doctors can become certified as sleep medicine
          specialists, including primary care physicians, pediatricians, and
          neurologists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sleep medicine specialists are experts at diagnosing and managing
          sleep-related conditions. If your primary care physician isn’t a
          certified sleep specialist, they may refer you to one.
        </p>

        <h2>Neurologist</h2>
        <p>
          You may also be referred to a neurologist. A neurologist is a doctor
          with in-depth training in nervous systems disorders. An imbalance in
          your brain chemistry can cause many negative symptoms, including
          insomnia. Neurologists also treat restless leg syndrome, a common
          cause of insomnia.
        </p>

        <h2>Psychologist or Psychiatrist</h2>
        <p>
          Psychologists and psychiatrists can help treat some cases of insomnia.
          A psychologist is a social scientist who has studied behavior and
          mental processes. A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in the
          diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. A psychiatrist can
          prescribe drugs, while a psychologist can’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          A psychologist or psychiatrist can offer counseling or behavioral
          therapy to help treat your insomnia. They can also treat other mental
          health conditions that might be causing your sleep problems.
        </p>

        <h2>Complementary and Alternative Medicine Practitioners</h2>
        <p>
          Many practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine offer
          treatments for insomnia. For example, certified yoga and meditation
          instructors can help you learn relaxation techniques that could help
          you sleep better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Massage therapists can also help you relax and relieve tense muscles
          that may be disturbing your sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          A review article published in the Journal of Alternative and
          Complementary Medicine suggests that acupuncture is also an effective
          treatment for insomnia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talk to your doctor before you try any complementary or alternative
          medicine. While some treatments are supported by scientific research,
          others are not.
        </p>

        <h2>Prepare for Your Appointment</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re having trouble falling or staying asleep, make an
          appointment with your primary doctor. They may recommend lifestyle
          changes, medication changes, or other strategies to help you sleep
          better. They may also refer you to a specialist to help diagnose and
          manage your sleep problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the most out of your appointments, create a list of questions
          to ask your doctor or specialist. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What should I do to help with sleep problems?</li>
          <li>Will I have to take medications?</li>
          <li>If I don’t want to take medications, are there alternatives?</li>
          <li>How long will treatment take?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should also be prepared to answer questions like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are you under any new stress at work or at home?</li>
          <li>Has anything happened recently to upset you?</li>
          <li>Do you feel depressed or anxious?</li>
          <li>Are you currently taking any medications?</li>
          <li>What time do you usually go to bed?</li>
          <li>How long do you usually sleep?</li>
          <li>What time do you wake up?</li>
          <li>Do you feel restless at night?</li>
          <li>Do your muscles twitch when you lie down?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Insomnia can stop you from getting the sleep you need. Your doctor or
          sleep medicine specialist can recommend treatments to help you manage
          the condition.
