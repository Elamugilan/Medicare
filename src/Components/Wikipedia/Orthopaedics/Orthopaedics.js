        <h1>What is Orthopaedics?</h1>
        <p>
          Orthopaedics is a branch of medicine focused on the diagnosis,
          treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of musculoskeletal system
          disorders. This includes bones, joints, ligaments, tendons, and
          muscles. Orthopaedic surgeons are medical professionals specialized in
          treating these conditions through both surgical and non-surgical
          methods.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Orthopaedic Conditions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Fractures and dislocations</li>
          <li>Arthritis</li>
          <li>Back and neck pain</li>
          <li>Osteoporosis</li>
          <li>Tendinitis and bursitis</li>
          <li>Sports injuries</li>
          <li>Muscle and ligament injuries</li>
          <li>Congenital deformities (e.g., clubfoot)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Orthopaedic Treatments</h2>
        <p>
          Orthopaedic treatments can vary based on the specific condition and

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Physical Therapy:</strong> A non-invasive treatment that
            helps restore movement and strength through exercises and
            modalities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Medications:</strong> Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory
            drugs to manage symptoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Injections:</strong> Corticosteroid injections to reduce
            inflammation and pain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Surgery:</strong> Procedures like arthroscopy, joint
            replacement, or realignment to correct structural problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Orthotic Devices:</strong> Custom braces or supports to
            stabilize or assist in the function of a body part.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Orthopaedic Subspecialties</h2>

            and bone abnormalities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MRIs:</strong> High-resolution imaging to assess soft
            tissues like muscles, ligaments, and cartilage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Arthroscopy:</strong> Minimally invasive surgery using a
            small camera to examine and treat joint conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bone Scintigraphy:</strong> A nuclear imaging technique to
            evaluate bone metabolism and detect abnormalities.
